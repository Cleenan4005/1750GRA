      <h3>Ingredients </h3>
      <h4>For the pudding... </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups whole milk </li>
        <li>2 eggs </li>
        <li>&frac12; cup heavy cream </li>
        <li>&frac12; cup granulated sugar </li>
        <li>3 tbsp cornstarch </li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter </li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract </li>
        <li>&frac14; tsp salt </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>For serving (&aacute; la mode)... </h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1 scoop of vanilla ice cream (or your flavor of  choice) </li>
        <li>Any toppings of your choice (chocolate or caramel syrup, whipped cream, fresh fruit, nuts, ect.) </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <h3>Steps </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a medium saucepan, whisk together sugar, cornstarch, and salt. Slowly add the milk and cream, whisking until smooth.</li>
		<li>Place over medium heat, stirring constantly until the mixture begins to thicken and bubble (about 5–7 minutes).</li>
		<li>In a small bowl, lightly beat the egg yolks. Slowly pour in about ½ cup of the hot mixture while whisking to avoid scrambling. Then, return the egg mixture back into the saucepan.</li>
		<li>Continue to cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring, until thick and creamy. Remove from heat and stir in butter and vanilla extract.</li>
		<li>Pour pudding into a serving cup. Cover the surface with plastic wrap (to prevent a skin from forming) and chill at least 2 hours if serving cold—or keep warm for immediate serving.</li>
		<li>Just before serving, top your pudding cup with a scoop of ice cream. Garnish with your favorite toppings for extra indulgence.</li>
