    <h2> Pudding &aacute; la Mode </h2>
    <p>Pudding  la Mode is a delightful treat that combines the rich, creamy comfort of classic pudding with the sweet, chilly indulgence of ice cream. Each bite is a perfect balance of smooth, velvety texture and cool, dreamy flavor, making it a favorite for any occasion. Whether served warm or chilled, it’s a dessert that feels both nostalgic and special—simple yet elegant, and always satisfying.
